            Medical University of Sofia is the oldest institution for higher medical education in Bulgaria. His Majesty Zar Ferdinand founded it by decree in 1917 as a medical faculty of Sofia University. Special merits of its foundation and worthy to be remembered are doctors M. Russev, A.M. Petrov, St. Vatev, and P. Orahovatz who prepared Alexandrovska hospital’s departments for the needs of future clinics and organized training of teaching stuff. Among the first professors of medicine in Bulgaria are V. Mollov, P. Stojanov, St. Kirkovitch, Iv. Kiprov (first Dean), R.H. Kann, T. Petrov, Pashev, At. Teodorov, etc. In 1942 a dentistry department opened and its founders were Ass. prof. Sl. Davidov, Аss. prof. G. Stiljanov and Prof. Al. Stanishev.

In 1950, the Medical Faculty was set apart from Sofia University and became independent as a Medical Academy with two faculties: medicine and dentistry. In 1951 a pharmaceutical faculty was added. Next decades several administrative transformations took places — Higher Medical Institute (1954-1972), Medical Academy (1972-1990), and again Higher Medical Institute. Since 21 May 1995 according to the decision taken by the National Assembly, the Higher Medical Institute became a Medical University.

High level of theoretical and practical training of students, post-graduate students and specialists is organized according to the requirements of government standards of education and health care politics but with a sufficient academic independence.
