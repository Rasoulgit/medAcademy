            Because of the increasing interest towards the specialty, places for studying Veterinary Medicine are limited. There is high competition between the candidates due to the opportunities that the specialty offers. In many countries, the popularity of Veterinary Medicine Faculties has made the tuition fees more than unaffordable for the average student. Combined with the low places at the colleges and the high living costs, those options are no longer convenient. However, in Eastern Europe, the quality of education at the Medical Universities is excellent, while the costs of studying and living are reasonably priced. In Bulgaria you can obtain a Master’s Degree in Veterinary for around 4,200 euros per academic year.
