                        <p>
                            Larnaca College (www.larnacacollege.ac.cy) is one of the most vibrant colleges set up in Larnaca Cyprus and offers high standards of private education on a wide range of programs to students from around the world. Larnaca College is duly registered and recognised from the ministry of ‘Education and Culture of Cyprus.  We have registered with the Ministry of Education and Culture in Cyprus a BA in Business Administration and a BA in Hospitality and Tourism. Larnaca College is an approved centre of ATHE in the UK (www.atheuk.com), Confederation of Tourism and Hospitality of the UK (www.cthawards.com) and also Northern Council of Further Education from the UK (www.ncge.org.uk). Larnaca college students can be transferred to the UK for further studies at any time, if they wish to do so.
                            In October 2012 the Association of International Accountants has approved Larnaca College to run AIA Professional Qualifications.
                            The Faculty consists of highly qualified academic instructors, experienced practitioners and researchers who know how to enrich the educational experience of students.
                            The facilities, the number and standard of lecturers and the coordination of courses complying with the innovative European Education System, all contribute to giving Larnaca College the prestige and unique characteristics of a European College.
                            The college motto ‘Knowledge-Wisdom-Success’ underlies the philosophy of the college. It is an extension of the ethos of the college which is characterized by a democratic and positive climate, respect for each other, understanding and cooperation.
                            The College stands in its own new building, situated in the center of Larnaca amongst all the cities facilities. The ground floor consists of the main entrance and houses all the students’ personal lockers. The first floor offers covered, ample parking for staff and students. The second floor consists of the reception area, administrative offices, faculty offices,   PC-lab, cafeteria, Library and the Directors office.
                            All Lecture rooms and auditoriums are on the third floor. Both the third and second floors offer ample toilet and wash room facilities.
                            Larnaca College is dedicated to developing new programs from short-term certificate courses, to doctoral programs that meet the academic/professional needs of professionals, as well as the needs of our graduates who are entering a rapidly changing social and economic marketplace.
                            In view of the increasing interest from students from third countries to study in European academic Institutes, Larnaca College, seeks to establish collaboration with a Medical University in order to broaden the choice and enhance the quality of academic and professional programmes we can offer to our home and International students.
                            Therefore, we are interested in establishing cooperative possibilities with Sophia University School of Medicine in order to offer part of the Degree in Medicine in Cyprus at Larnaca College premises. Successful students can continue their studies in Sophia in order to complete the Degree in Medicine.
                            We are at your disposal at any time for a meeting.
